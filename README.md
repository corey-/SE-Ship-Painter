# Instructions
* After running the tool, click on Load Blueprint and select your blueprint. (It should be in roaming appdata -> SpaceEngineers -> Blueprints -> Local)  
* Click on the colored square to choose your color. 
* Check the boxes to choose whether to include light or heavy armor blocks.
* Click Paint

It's that simple. It can even be done while you are in game, so you can keep tweaking the color without having to restart your game.
